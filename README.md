## Changes Made for PostgreSQL

1. **AUTO_INCREMENT â†’ SERIAL**  
   - Replaced MySQL `INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT` with PostgreSQL `SERIAL PRIMARY KEY`.

2. **Data Types**  
   - Data types like `VARCHAR` and `INT` remained the same and are compatible.

3. **Foreign Keys**  
   - Foreign key constraints syntax stayed consistent with minor adjustments handled automatically.

4. **Insert Statements**  
   - No changes required; inserts work identically in PostgreSQL.

---

## Verification

- Tables created successfully in PostgreSQL.
- Sample data inserted correctly.
- Verified data integrity with `SELECT COUNT(*)` and sample queries.
- Sample advanced queries (window functions, CTEs, subqueries) run without issues.

---

## Conclusion

Migration from MySQL to PostgreSQL completed with minimal changes, mainly around the `SERIAL` keyword for auto-increment columns. The database schema and sample data are now fully compatible with PostgreSQL.
